This is a fork of [a fork](https://github.com/dwastberg/pynanoflann) of [the unofficial python wrapper](https://github.com/u1234x1234/pynanoflann) to the [nanoflann](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann) library. The main distinguishing feature of this fork is that it's installable from pip; none of the actual code has been modified. 


The nanoflann implementation of [k-d tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) provides one of the best performance for many k-nearest neighbour problems. At Rowan, we're interested in this because it helps with optimizing [neural network potentials](https://rowansci.com/publications/introduction-to-nnps).

# Install

```
pip install pynanoflann
```
